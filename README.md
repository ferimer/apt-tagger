# APT TAGGER

Script to manage Debian repositories in an easy way

## Introduction

I love Debian mainly for it's awesome package manager. This package manager is a fantastic tool but it lacks a way to tell the system "why you installed one or another package"

I'm used to install many packages for testing or for a project but when the time passes and you finished the project you have too many packages to remove (one by one)

To solve this I used to create my own meta-packages with the project's name so it's easy to know why you installed the packages.

Since this is a tedious task I implemented this script so now you can use this idea too.

Feel free to comment, suggest PR or whatever !

## How to use

apt-tagger [options]

## Pending work

* Apt-tagger own package ;)
* Manual page -> With DOCBOOK5
* Help page - Using man page?
* Test if the package is already in or not
* Test if the tagname is a valid package into the repository - adding a prefix to them?
* GIT support for each created package -> So each change will generate a commit. Also integrate with github to allow shared metapackages
* On purge package, remove also the deb files
* Manage package versions
